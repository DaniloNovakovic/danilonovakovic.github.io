# Personal website

## Brief

The goal is to create a place where I can easily view my interesting personal open-source projects and exercises, while also giving breif info about myself with possiblity of attracting and connecting with like-minded individuals.

## Personal log / my thoughts on each version:

### v2 (current):

- I tried to combine multiple designs/ideas of the pages I liked on the internet instead of making my own design from scratch (because I'm not a graphic designer).
- Everything scales with em/rem making it very easy with the help of fluid typography for content to look decent on the bigger screens.
- Got experience in setting up & working with SASS locally, as well as improving my skills in flexbox and css grids
- Created my first usable component (project card) that i really liked - https://codepen.io/danilonovakovic/full/xJaxjd
- Each section takes at least 90vh or more which makes it look a lot better compared to v1
- Navbar is responsive and always accessible

### v1:

- This version of site was a very basic one. I was learning how to use github pages, it served as a great project/place to apply knowledge as I was learning it but ultimately I ended up deciding to redo everything from scratch in a new version (v2).

- Things that I disliked in this version(v1):
  - I used px/pt instead of em/rem making it very hard to change font, make fluid-typography (which i didn't make anyway)
  - While I did think about smaller/mobile screens I did NOT think about the big screen, which made my site look very bad on big monitors
  - There weren't a lot of spaces compared to the landing page (for example landing/hero page took whole viewport while other ones just took a small fraction of the screen making it very weird)
  - I didn't really like that my projects were shown with just words, I feel like it is much more interesting to show snippet of project with a picture and small description then just name of the project in `<a>` tag.
