# Personal website
## Brief
The goal is to create a place where i can store all of my interesting open-source projects and exercises making it easy for users to download my programs for free, leave feedback, and connect with like minded individuals.

## Personal log / my thoughts on each version:

### v2 (current, in-progress):
- I tried to combine multiple designs/ideas of the pages i liked on the internet instead of making my own design from scratch (because i'm not a graphic designer). 
- Everything scales with em/rem making it very easy with the help of fluid typography for content to look great on the bigger screens.
- Got experience in setting up & working with SASS locally, aswell as improving my skills in flexbox and css grids
- Created my first usable component (project card) that i really liked - https://codepen.io/danilonovakovic/full/xJaxjd
- Each section takes at least 90vh or more which makes it look alot better compared to v1

### v1:
- This version of site was a very basic one. I was learning html/css and have just learned how to use github pages, it served as a great project/place to apply knowledge as i was learning it (making my site more and more responsive) but ultimately i ended up deciding to redo everything from scratch in a new version.

- Things that i disliked in this version(v1):
  - I used px/pt instead of em/rem making it very hard to change font, make fluid-typography (which i didn't make anyway)
  - While i did think about smaller/mobile screens i did NOT think about the big screen, which made my site look very bad on big monitors
  - There weren't alot of spaces compared to the landing page (for example landing/hero page took whole viewport while other ones just took a small fraction of the screen making it very weird)
  - I didn't really like that my projects were shown with just words, i feel like it is much more interesting to show snippet of project with a picture and small description then just name of the project in `<a>` tag.
